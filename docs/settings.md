# Settings in Kindling

Kindling has two layers of settings: app-wide settings that apply to every project, and project-specific settings for individual manuscripts.

## App Settings (Kindling Settings)

App settings control your author and contact information, which is used on exported title pages.

- Author name
- Contact address (two lines)
- Phone
- Email

## Project Settings

Project settings customize metadata for a single project:

- Pen name (overrides app-level author name for this project)
- Genre
- Project description
- Word target

## Reference Type Settings

Reference types are managed from the References panel settings cog. You can enable or disable reference types per project (characters, locations, items, objectives, organizations).

## Export Impact

Settings influence exports in several places:

- Title pages use app settings and project pen name
- Genre and description appear in exported metadata
- Word target helps track progress during drafting
