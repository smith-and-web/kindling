# Scene Workflow in Kindling

Scenes are where you turn your outline into prose. Each scene combines beats, synopsis, and metadata to keep your draft structured.

## Scene Panel Layout

When you open a scene, the Scene panel shows its beats, synopsis, and metadata controls in one place.

## Beats and Prose

- Beats are collapsible cards that act as prompts
- Expand a beat to write prose directly beneath it
- Prose auto-saves as you write
- Collapse a beat to keep the outline visible while you draft

## Synopsis Editing

Use the synopsis field to capture a short summary for the scene. Synopses can be edited inline and are saved automatically.

## Scene Type and Status

Scene metadata helps you filter and organize your outline:

- **Type**: Normal, Notes, ToDo, or Unused
- **Status**: Draft, Revised, Final

These controls influence scene filters in the sidebar and are used in exports.

## Scene Locking

Locked scenes (or scenes inside locked chapters) are read-only. Unlock the scene to edit beats, prose, or metadata.
